Step 4 â†’ Hook

File: src/hooks/useAuth.js

Why: So inside your pages (Login, Register), you can easily use:

const { user, login, logout } = useAuth();

Step 5 â†’ Connect Forms

Files: src/pages/Auth/Login.jsx, src/pages/Auth/Register.jsx

Why: Forms should now call authApi.js, then use login() from context.

What:

On submit â†’ call API â†’ update context â†’ redirect to HomePage.

Step 6 â†’ Routing Protection (Optional for now)

File: src/routes/PrivateRoute.jsx (later)

Why: To stop users from accessing chat pages if not logged in.

What: Wraps around protected routes (like Home/Chat).

ðŸš€ Execution Order

authApi.js

authService.js

AuthContext.jsx

useAuth.js

Connect Login & Register pages

ðŸ‘‰ Once these are done, youâ€™ll have a fully working authentication system.

Do you want me to start with Step 1 (authApi.js) and write it in a clean way for your backend controllers?
